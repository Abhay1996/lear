		This document describes how to choose, setup and use a webcam in Ubuntu. If you are reading this page, you are probably in either/both of the following situations:

Looking for information on which webcam to buy.
Trying to setup and use your existing webcam.
Please note that this document is intended for the current release: Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat). Information for earlier versions can be found here.

1. Choosing a Webcam
Webcam support in Linux is mainly provided by the Linux UVC Project's UVC driver. This aims to provide a universal driver in the same way that a generic driver handles USB storage devices (memory sticks, hard drives etc). However, other drivers also exist that may allow more devices to be used. When looking to purchase a webcam for use with Ubuntu, you should look for a UVC compatible camera. The Linux-UVC project has a good list of UVC compatible webcams.
